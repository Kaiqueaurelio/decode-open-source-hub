# Decode frontend

This Nx workspace contains the Tauri desktop frontend in `apps/Decode` and its
shared libraries in `libs`. Website and Netlify builds live in `Decode-services`.

Use Node.js 20 or newer and npm. Run the following commands from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm ci
npx nx dev Decode
npx nx build Decode
```

The frontend development server uses port 5173. Start the Rust app separately
from the repository root:

```bash
./script/Decode/unix_rust_dev.sh
```

The repository-root frontend launcher installs dependencies and starts the same
server:

```bash
./script/Decode/unix_frontend_dev.sh
```

On Windows, use `script/Decode/windows_frontend_dev.ps1` and
`script/Decode/windows_rust_dev.ps1` in separate terminals. See
[development setup](../_docs/dev_setup.md) for Rust and Tauri prerequisites.

The Vite build writes `apps/Decode/dist`, which Tauri bundles. Public resources
come from `apps/Decode/app/public`. The app also needs its retained libraries,
root package lock, TypeScript project references, and Nx/Vite configuration.
The aliases in `tsconfig.base.json` resolve shared libraries to their source for
both development and production. The app's Vite configuration loads this file
explicitly so imports inside shared libraries use the same aliases. The desktop
build does not require library `dist/` outputs or a separate library build.

Import shared libraries by the names declared in their `package.json` files:

```ts
import { Button } from "@storyteller/ui-button";
import { Modal } from "@storyteller/ui-modal";
```

Use the workspace-local Nx version through `npx nx`. `npm ci` and the release
workflows use the checked-in lockfile; do not reinstall different Nx versions
inside CI.

`clean_modules.sh` is an explicit cleanup command that removes build outputs,
Nx caches, and frontend dependencies. Do not run it when preserving local build
outputs during repository pruning.
